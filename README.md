# DiplomacyApp
App to speed up order creation in Diplomacy board game

There are three phases to this project.

**Phase** 1 (beta done, in beta2 folder)
- create a small phone webapp to speed up order creation by users

Phase 2 
- create an interactive SVG webapp of the Diplomacy map 
- allow users to create/delete new units and supply depots
- zoomable map
- draggable unit and supply depot icons

Limitations
- one user will be responsible to move the pieces (ideally played on a large TV)

Phase 3 
- use Node.js or WebSockets to create piece moves
  - joining the orders created in the app from Phase 1 with the svg map in Phase 2
- alternatively, let players play on their own computer and communicate with each other with orders they create
